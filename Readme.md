Cognitio Books
==============

This is a unviersity project about SEO optimization. The project is a static website for an online bookstore. I've used bookdepository as reference, since I like their site. 

The site is hosted here on GitHub Pages: https://boyan13.github.io/CognitioBooks/

Not all books on the main page have their own pages, and since there's no server the Search and Cart options don't function. 

Clickable books are: 
* Dune 2013 Paperback/Hardback
* Dune 2011 
* The Office
* A Clash Of Kings
